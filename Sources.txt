The source of the Hudson River is Henderson Lake, located in the Adirondack Mountains at an elevation of 4,322 ft (1,317 m).[26][27] However, the photogenic Lake Tear of the Clouds is more conventionally cited in popular culture as the source of the Hudson.[28] The river is named Feldspar Brook from where it emerges from Lake Tear of the Clouds until its confluence with the Opalescent River, after which it becomes the Opalescent until it reaches Calamity Brook flowing southward into the eastern outlet of Henderson Lake. After this point, the stream is known as the Hudson River[29][30][31] according to the cartographical definition used by the United States Geological Survey (USGS).[7]

USGS maps show the longest source of the Hudson as the Opalescent on the western slopes of Little Marcy Mountain,[32][33] originating two miles north of Lake Tear of the Clouds.[33][34]

Upper Hudson River
Using river names as seen on maps, Indian Pass Brook flows into Henderson Lake. The outlet of Henderson Lake is most commonly referred to as the official start of the Hudson River, as it flows east and meets the southwest flowing Calamity Brook. The confluence of the two rivers however is where most maps begin to use the Hudson River name on a cartographical basis. South of the outlet of Sanford Lake, the Opalescent River flows into the Hudson.[4]

The Hudson then flows south, taking in Beaver Brook and the outlet of Lake Harris. After its confluence with the Indian River, the Hudson forms the boundary between Essex and Hamilton counties. The Hudson flows entirely into Warren County in the hamlet of North River, and takes in the Schroon River at Warrensburg. Further south, the river forms the boundary between Warren and Saratoga Counties. The river then takes in the Sacandaga River from the Great Sacandaga Lake.[31]

Shortly thereafter, the river leaves the Adirondack Park, flows under Interstate 87, and through Glens Falls, just south of Lake George although receiving no streamflow from the lake. It next goes through Hudson Falls. At this point the river forms the boundary between Washington and Saratoga Counties.[31] Here the river has an elevation of 200 feet (61 m).[26] Just south in Fort Edward, the river reaches its confluence with the Champlain Canal,[31] which historically provided boat traffic between New York City and Montreal and the rest of Eastern Canada via the Hudson, Lake Champlain and the Saint Lawrence Seaway.[35]

Further south the Hudson takes in water from the Batten Kill River and Fish Creek near Schuylerville. The river then forms the boundary between Saratoga and Rensselaer counties. The river then enters the heart of the Capital District. It takes in water from the Hoosic River, which extends into Massachusetts. Shortly thereafter the river has its confluence with the Mohawk River, the largest tributary of the Hudson River, in Waterford.[26][31] The river then reaches the Federal Dam in Troy, marking an impoundment of the river.[31] At an elevation of 2 feet (0.61 m), the bottom of the dam marks the beginning of the tidal influence in the Hudson as well as the beginning of the lower Hudson River.[26]
